# Finansight

This is a desktop application for personal financial management, based on Vue.js, Rust and SQLite (on Tauri). It's purpose is to be an offline resource to provide visibility on personal data about purchases, expenses, etc, using tag based filters for easier manipulation of datasets.
Data input is as simplified as possible, and presentation should make it easier to determine transaction scopes, so a user can get the best insight possible out of the available data, as well as comparing datasets for proper transactions analyzis.
